NOTE:
A few things happened. First: I got the ability to pull / push again! Kinda. It still doesnt't like me, but we're better than we were before. Now... I've also got some weird artifacts in here - for example, the jupyter notebook is in a couple of different places; I just found a copy in the data file. Not sure why, but it's there and it's too late at night for me to worry about it. This also isn't my most current version of the notebook, I've got other changes that haven't propogated yet, so I wouldn't start working on this just yet! I'll push out the current version shortly.
